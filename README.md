# Overview

This is the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game. You can play locally against other another player (or yourself if you so wish) or you can play against a remote player. If nobody joins the game within 15 seconds of you joining, the game will start in local mode.

The rules are of the classic game where each player takes a turn. The symbol (player) whose turn it is turns green. If playing against a remote player, the other player's symbol will turn red signaling that you're waiting for their move. If the remote player drops, your symbols will turn blue.

To start a new game, simply refresh your browser.
